# Web-Scraping-Challenge
This repository contains the deliverables that are required for the Module 11 - Web Scraping Challenge

As part of this work we went ahead and reviewed two websites that are specifically designed for scraping.   We reviewed the websites for Mars News and Weather, scraped the websites for different points of data and answered queries in Jupyter Notebook based on the findings.
